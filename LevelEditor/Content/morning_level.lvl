T Level 3 - The Last Fight
S The next morning starts and after a hard fight, the apes want to make sure that the lumberjacks|won't ever come again.||But the lumberjacks are way better prepared now than in the last fights, because now they know the rainforest|as well as the weaknesses of the apes.||Who will win this last fight?
